blogger by Colin Wahl

This is a project for the web development curriculum found [here.](http://www.theodinproject.com/home)

Made with the guidance of [jumpstartlab.](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

As something new, I will be documenting every commit I make here in the readme.  Additionally, I will be keeping a running list of things I learn in the commit documentation (similar to what I did in my first blog project).

Commit #1:
- Initial Commit, just putting the project up on GitHub

Commit #2:
- Updating the README, nothing important here.

Commit #3:
- Created the Article Database, and used rails console (irb) to create some same articles
- Learned that you must save an article before it will be put in the database, just creating a new article isn't enough
- Learned how relational algebra underlies databases
